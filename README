The idea is to create a sort of swiss-army-knife library of string functions, regular expressions and perhaps NLP scripts. Anything esoteric but convenient is welcome.

eg. 
- different types of date format transformation
- changing name formats eg. 'John Smith ---> Mr J Smith' or 'John Smith ---> Smith, John'
- etc.
